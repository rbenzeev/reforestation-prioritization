# Title: RShiny App for Reforestation Prioritization

### This repo serves as the home for all files relating to my 2019 dissertation research prioritizing reforestation sites in the Atlantic Forest, Bahia, Brazil

### As an output of my research I hope to create a tool to prioritize sites for reforestation that accounts both for biodiversity priority areas and for those places where community support is strong enough to ensure the long-term success of the reforestation project. 

### To run from Shiny and RStudio:
1. Clone the repository https://github.com/rbenzeev/reforestation-prioritization or download it and decompress the zip file
2. Open the reforestation-prioritization.R file in RStudio
3. Click on Run App inside the RStudio interface
